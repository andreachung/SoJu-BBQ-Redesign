# SoJu-BBQ-Redesign
Redesign of SoJu BBQ Website

I coded this website in HTML and CSS from scratch as a project for my Website Design 2 class. 
We had to redesign a website for a local business of our choice
They are not actually our clients, this is just a hypothetical website and rebranding.
I also changed the logo and website colors.
Again, this website is a class project and the restaurant is not affiliated in any way.
